    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100g pancetta</li>
      <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
      <li>50g parmesan</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>350g spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
      <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
      <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>STEP 1
      <br>
      Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
      
      <li>STEP 2
      <br>
      Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. 
      Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>

      <li>STEP 3
      <br>
      Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little 
      freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</li>

      <li>STEP 4
      <br>
      Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when 
      the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>

      <li>STEP 5
      <br>
      Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, jus
      t to bruise it.</li>

      <li>STEP 6
      <br>
      While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 
      Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>

      <li>STEP 7
      <br>
      Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often,
      until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>

      <li>STEP 8
      <br>
      Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, l
      ift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying 
      pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well 
      (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</li>

      <li>STEP 9
      <br>
      Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back
      for sprinkling over later.</li>

      <li>STEP 10
      <br>
      Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs
      and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily w
      ith the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.</li>

      <li>STEP 11
      <br>
      Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). Y
      ou don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>

      <li>STEP 12
      <br>
      Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve imm
      ediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.
      If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water 
      and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</li>
